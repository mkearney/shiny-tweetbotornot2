The tweetbotornot2 model is a machine learning algorithm that was trained on thousands of real bot and non-bot Twitter accounts. It takes into account over one hundred different features derived from (a) user-level attributes–e.g., names, profile information such as url, description, and location, account creation date, number and rate of statuses, favorited tweets, lists, friends, followers–(b) top-level tweeting patterns–frequency, proportion, and timing of pure/original tweets, quoted statuses, retweets, number of favorites, retweets–and (c) text-based patterns in user tweets–e.g., number of hashtags, mentions, and links, length of tweets, punctuation, word complexity, etc.–in addition to several other features. The model is currently in development, meaning what you see here is not the final model. Once completed, the final model will be submitted for academic peer review and publication. When that happens, it'll be noted here (with apppropriate citations/links) as well. With that said, tweetbotornot's estimates merely reflect the extent to which a given account is similar to a number of known bot (automated) accounts. This model does provide proof of automated, non-human, or inauthentic behaviors. In addition, although the error rate during validation was small, due to there likely being a lot more non-bots than bots on Twitter, the number of false positives (actual non-bot accounts that receive bot probabilities greater than .50) may still be relatively large.
